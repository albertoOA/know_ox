pair_0,"A is cheaper, shorter, and slower than B. A is shorter than C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, and T. A is slower than D, H, I, L, N, R, and T. A is better than C, G, K, Q, and S. A is cheaper than H, J, L, R, and T. Key metrics: B has a makespan of 21.0, while A's makespan is 34.5 (higher). B has 7.0 tasks vs. A's 3.0, and costs 39.0 vs. A's 24.5. Plans like D, H, I, L, N, R, and T have higher makespans than B, and some (H, J, L, R, T) also have higher costs than A.","Simplified language, grouped comparisons, removed redundant details, and condensed numerical data while preserving key relationships.",qwen3:8b
pair_1,"Plan A is cheaper, shorter, faster, and better than Plan C. It also outperforms other plans (B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, T) in cost, duration, speed, and quality. Specifically: 

- A's makespan (34.5) is lower than C's (49.8) and most others (G, K, Q, S). 
- A has fewer tasks (3) than C (6) and most others. 
- A's cost (24.5) is lower than C's (67.8) and all other plans listed. 
- Plans D, G, and B are cheaper than C but not as good as A. 
- D and G are better than C but not as efficient as A.","Simplified complex comparisons into concise bullet points, grouped similar plans, and highlighted numerical values for key metrics while retaining all essential relationships.",qwen3:8b
pair_2,"Plan A is cheaper, shorter, and slower than Plan D. A has a higher makespan (34.5) than D's (31.4), fewer tasks (3 vs D's 4.5), and lower cost (24.5 vs D's 42.9). A is better than K and S. D has the same number of tasks as S. Other plans like B, H, I, J, L, N, R, T are more expensive than A, but D is the most expensive. D's tasks are more than H, I, K, P, R, but fewer than S.","Simplified language, condensed comparisons, and prioritized key metrics (cost, makespan, tasks) while retaining all numerical values and relative relationships.",qwen3:8b
pair_3,"Plan A is worse than Plan E in cost, duration, and task count. A is also slower and more expensive than B, D, H, I, J, L, N, O, R, T, and F, O, P. E has lower makespan (17.2), fewer tasks (2.8), and lower cost (12.2) than A (makespan 34.5, 3.0 tasks, $24.5). Other plans like B, D, H, L, and O have higher makespan than E but lower than A.","Simplified comparisons, grouped similar points, removed redundant numerical repetitions, and streamlined phrasing while retaining all key relationships and values.",qwen3:8b
pair_4,"Plan A is more expensive than F, O, and P, but has fewer tasks (3.0) than F (5.3). A is the slowest plan with a makespan of 34.5, worse than all others. F is the fastest (makespan 10.1) and cheapest (cost 15.6). A is also worse than E and O but better than K and S. Plan B is slower and worse than F.","Simplified complex comparisons into clear, concise points focusing on cost, speed, and task count. Removed redundant details while retaining key metrics and relative rankings.",qwen3:8b
