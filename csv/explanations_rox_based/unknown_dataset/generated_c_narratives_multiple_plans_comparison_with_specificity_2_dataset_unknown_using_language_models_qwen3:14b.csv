Pair ID,Explanation,Modifications
pair_0,"Plan A is less expensive than B, shorter than B, but slower. It is also shorter than many plans (C, D, F, G, etc.) but slower than some (D, H, I, L, N, R, T). A is more efficient than C, G, K, Q, S and cheaper than H, J, L, R, T. Plan B has a makespan of 'B makespan,' with 'B number of tasks' and 'B cost.' Most plans (C, D, F, etc.) are shorter than B, but some (D, H, I, L, N, R, T) are slower. H, J, L, R, T are cheaper than B, and F, J, P are more efficient than B.","Simplified language, merged repetitive comparisons, grouped similar plan relations, and shortened explanations while retaining all key attributes and comparisons."
pair_1,"Plan A is more cost-effective, shorter, faster, and better than Plan C. It is also cheaper than many other plans (B, D, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, Q, R, S, T) and shorter than several (D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, R, S). A is faster and better than G, K, Q, S. Plan A has a makespan of 'A makespan', 'A number of tasks', and cost 'A cost', while Plan C has 'C makespan', 'C number of tasks', and 'C cost'. Other plans like B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, R, S are also cheaper, shorter, or better than C, and G, K, Q, S are faster than C.","Condensed repetitive comparisons into general statements, simplified language (e.g., 'cheaper plan' â†’ 'more cost-effective'), and removed redundant lists while retaining all key metric comparisons between A and C."
pair_2,"Plan A is more cost-effective and shorter than Plan D but slower. It is also cheaper and shorter than B, H, I, J, L, N, R, and T, and better than K and S. Plan D has the same number of tasks as S and is more expensive than B, H, I, J, L, N, R, and T. However, H, I, P, and R are shorter and better than D.","Simplified language, removed repetitive comparisons, grouped similar attributes, and condensed lists for brevity."
pair_3,"Plan A is more expensive, longer, slower, and worse than Plan E. It is also slower than multiple plans (B, D, H, I, J, L, N, O, R, T). Additionally, A is more expensive than F, O, and P. Compared to E, A has a higher cost ('A cost' vs. 'E cost'), more tasks ('A number of tasks' vs. 'E number of tasks'), and a longer expected makespan ('A makespan' vs. 'E makespan'). Many plans (B, D, H, I, J, L, N, O, R, T) are both slower and worse than E. Furthermore, F, O, and P are more expensive than E.","Condensed repeated comparisons, grouped similar plans, removed redundancy while preserving all key attributes and relationships."
pair_4,"Plan A is more expensive, shorter, and slower than F. It is also slower than B, D, E, H, I, J, L, N, O, P, R, T. A is shorter than D, H, I, K, L, P, R, S. A has a specific makespan ('A makespan'), number of tasks ('A number of tasks'), and cost ('A cost') compared to F's values. A is worse than E, O, and K, S. Most plans (B, D, E, H, I, J, L, N, O, P, R, T) are slower than F. D, H, I, K, L, P, R, S are shorter than F. Additionally, B, J, N, T are worse than F, while O and P are more expensive than F.","Condensed repetitive comparisons, grouped similar relationships, removed redundant 'and' structures, and preserved key metrics (makespan, tasks, cost) for clarity and brevity."
