Pair ID,Explanation,Modifications
pair_0,"Plan A is cheaper, shorter, and slower than Plan B. A is shorter than C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, and T. A is slower than D, H, I, L, N, R, and T. A is better than C, G, K, Q, and S. A is cheaper than H, J, L, R, and T. Plan A has a makespan of 'A makespan', while B has 'B makespan'. A has 'A number of tasks' tasks, versus B's 'B number of tasks'. A's cost is 'A cost', compared to B's 'B cost'. Most other plans (C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, R, S, T) are shorter than B but slower than B. H, J, L, R, and T are cheaper than B. F, J, and P are better than B.","Simplified complex comparisons into concise phrases, grouped similar relationships, and reduced redundancy while preserving all key attributes (cost, duration, speed, metrics)."
pair_1,"Plan A is the cheapest, shortest, fastest, and best option compared to C and many others (B, D, G, H, I, K, L, N, Q, R, S, T). It has a lower cost, fewer tasks, and a shorter makespan than C. Other plans like D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, R, S are also cheaper, shorter, and better than C but not necessarily better than A.","Simplified language by grouping repeated comparisons, reduced redundancy, and condensed attribute descriptions while retaining all key relationships and metrics."
pair_2,"A is the cheapest and shortest plan compared to B, H, I, J, L, N, R, T, K, and S. It is slower than D. D has the same number of tasks as S. B, H, I, J, L, N, R, T are cheaper than D. H, I, K, P, R are shorter than D and better than D. A is better than K and S.","Simplified complex comparisons into concise statements, removed redundant details, and grouped similar relationships (e.g., listing multiple cheaper plans under one sentence)."
pair_3,"Plan A is more expensive, longer, slower, and worse than E. It's also slower than B, D, H, I, J, L, N, O, R, and T. A costs more than F, O, and P. A has higher makespan and task count than E, but lower cost. E is faster, cheaper, and better than most plans, including B, D, H, I, J, L, N, R, T, and O.","Simplified language, removed redundant comparisons, grouped similar relationships, and condensed metric details."
pair_4,"Plan A is more expensive, shorter, and slower than F. A is slower than B, D, E, H, I, J, L, N, O, P, R, T. A is shorter than D, H, I, K, L, P, R, S. A has a makespan of 'A makespan' and 'A number of tasks' tasks, while F has 'F makespan' and 'F number of tasks'. A is worse than E, O, K, S, B, J, N, T. O and P are more expensive than F.","Simplified complex comparisons into concise statements, grouped related attributes, removed redundant phrases, and used clearer language while preserving all original relationships."
